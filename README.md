# Project VCT Champions 2022

## Why I did this project? 
  This project was made due to the love that I have, first for analyzing data and then for the FPS game called Valorant. I also took data that I know the meaning of and I also know how to handle them, in order to create my first project. 

## Which language was used?
  The entire project was done on the Jupyter platform, using the python language and its libraries. In this project I used only three libraries, Numpy, Pandas and MatPlotLib, for data analysis and visualization.

## Which database was used?
  I grabbed a public database from the Kaggle website, here is the link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suvanarayan/valorant-champions-2022-agent-and-map-picks?select=player_stats.csv">player_stats.csv</a>
